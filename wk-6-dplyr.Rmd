### 5.7.1.2 Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?



### 5.7.1.4 For each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each, flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.



### 5.7.1.6 Look at each destination. Can you find flights that are suspiciously fast? (i.e. flights that represent a potential data entry error). Compute the air time a flight relative to the shortest flight to that destination. Which flights were most delayed in the air?



### 13.4.6. 1 Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. (See R4DS for code to help here.)
